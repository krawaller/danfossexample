Hello Danfoss! Thank you for a fun couple of days! :)

Here is the promised delivery of the composition case study we made together. There are two versions:

* **Sandbox version**, consisting of a single html file, which you can run from the `demos` directory of the course material
* **Production version**, which is more like the real thing, but requires you to do `npm install` and then `npm run build` in the folder before you open `index.html` in the browser.

Best of luck, hope to hear from you down the road!
